I can write a PowerShell script to migrate a classic Application Insights resource to a workspace-based resource. Here is one possible solution:

# Get the name and resource group of the Application Insights resource
$appInsightsName = "yourAppInsightsName"
$appInsightsResourceGroup = "yourAppInsightsResourceGroup"

# Get the Application Insights resource object
$appInsights = Get-AzApplicationInsights -Name $appInsightsName -ResourceGroupName $appInsightsResourceGroup

# Get the name and resource group of the Log Analytics workspace
$workspaceName = "yourWorkspaceName"
$workspaceResourceGroup = "yourWorkspaceResourceGroup"

# Get the Log Analytics workspace object
$workspace = Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -Name $workspaceName -ResourceGroupName $workspaceResourceGroup

# Get the workspace ID
$workspaceId = $workspace.ResourceId

# Update the Application Insights resource to use the workspace ID
Update-AzApplicationInsights -Name $appInsightsName -ResourceGroupName $appInsightsResourceGroup -WorkspaceResourceId $workspaceId

This script will update the specified Application Insights resource to use the specified Log Analytics workspace for storing and analyzing the telemetry data. You can modify the script to suit your needs by changing the variables or adding error handling. You can also use the web search results to learn more about the cmdlets and parameters used in the script https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/convert-classic-resource https://zimmergren.net/upgrade-application-insights-to-workspace-based-from-legacy/ https://nmw.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16831648804375-Migrate-to-Workspace-based-Application-Insights-from-Classic. I hope this helps you with your task. blush
