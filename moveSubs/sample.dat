Okay, I can try to generate a document comparing Azure Disk Encryption with Azure Encryption at Host for you.

Please wait a moment while I create it.

Here is the document that I generated. I hope you find it useful. blush

# Azure Disk Encryption vs Azure Encryption at Host

Azure Disk Encryption and Azure Encryption at Host are two options for encrypting your data stored on Azure managed disks. In this document, we will compare and contrast these two options based on what they are, how they differ technically, and how they compare price wise.

## What they are

•  Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is a solution that encrypts the OS and data disks of Azure virtual machines (VMs) inside your VMs by using the BitLocker feature of Windows or the DM-Crypt feature of Linux. ADE is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets, with the option to encrypt with a key encryption key (KEK).

•  Azure Encryption at Host (EAH) is a VM option that encrypts the data stored on the VM host at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage service. EAH ensures that all temp disks and disk caches are encrypted at rest and in transit, enhancing the security of Azure Disk Storage Server-Side Encryption.


## How they differ technically

•  ADE encrypts the data on the disks attached to your VMs, while EAH encrypts the data on the host where your VMs run. ADE requires you to install an extension on your VMs, while EAH does not require any installation or configuration on your VMs.

•  ADE encrypts the data before it leaves the VM and decrypts it after it arrives at the VM, while EAH encrypts the data after it leaves the VM and decrypts it before it arrives at the VM. ADE protects your data from unauthorized access by the storage service or by anyone who has access to the physical disks, while EAH protects your data from unauthorized access by the host or by anyone who has access to the host memory or caches.

•  ADE supports customer-managed keys and platform-managed keys, while EAH only supports platform-managed keys. ADE allows you to use Azure Key Vault or Azure Key Vault Managed HSM to store and manage your encryption keys, while EAH does not require any key management service. ADE also allows you to use a key encryption key (KEK) to encrypt your disk encryption key (DEK), while EAH does not support KEK.

•  ADE and EAH have different restrictions and regional availability. ADE is not available on Basic, A-series VMs, or on VMs with less than 2 GB of memory. EAH is not available on legacy VM sizes. ADE is available in all regions, while EAH is not available in some regions for Ultra Disks and Premium SSD v2 managed disks. ADE and EAH are mutually exclusive and cannot be enabled on the same VM or disk.


## How they compare price wise

•  ADE and EAH have different pricing models and implications. ADE is free of charge, but it may incur additional costs for Azure Key Vault operations and storage, depending on your key management option and usage. EAH is also free of charge, but it may affect the performance and availability of your VMs, depending on your VM size and workload. EAH may also limit your VM size options and regional choices, depending on your disk type and encryption requirements.

•  ADE and EAH have different trade-offs and benefits. ADE gives you more control and flexibility over your encryption keys and secrets, but it also adds more complexity and overhead to your VM management and operations. EAH provides you with a simple and seamless encryption experience, but it also reduces your encryption options and capabilities. ADE and EAH both enhance the security and compliance of your data, but they also have different scopes and levels of protection.


## Conclusion

Azure Disk Encryption and Azure Encryption at Host are two encryption options for your Azure managed disks. They have different technical and pricing aspects, as well as different trade-offs and benefits. You should choose the option that best suits your security and compliance needs, as well as your VM and disk characteristics and preferences.
