🔹 Change Title

Integrate SNOWFLAKE_SPROUTSOCIAL_ANALYST Group with Snowflake via SCIM Provisioning

⸻

🔹 Change Description

A new Active Directory security group named SNOWFLAKE_SPROUTSOCIAL_ANALYST has been created and synchronized to Microsoft Entra ID.
This change involves assigning the group to the Snowflake Enterprise Application in Entra to enable automatic provisioning through SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management).

The integration ensures that user accounts and access memberships within this group are automatically provisioned and deprovisioned in Snowflake, aligning with organizational identity lifecycle management policies.

The S2SNOWFLAKE_POWERBI service account will also be included in the configuration as requested. Once completed, the task will be reassigned to the Cloud Services team for post-integration validation.

🔹 Justification

This change is required to enable automated user provisioning and lifecycle management between Microsoft Entra ID and Snowflake for the newly created SNOWFLAKE_SPROUTSOCIAL_ANALYST security group.

Enabling SCIM integration ensures that group membership changes in Active Directory and Entra ID are automatically reflected in Snowflake, reducing manual administration, eliminating access discrepancies, and improving security compliance.

This integration aligns with corporate identity governance policies and supports least privilege access by ensuring only authorized users can access Sprout Social data sources in Snowflake.

🔹 Implementation Plan

	1.	Confirm the SNOWFLAKE_SPROUTSOCIAL_ANALYST security group has successfully synchronized from on-prem AD to Microsoft Entra ID.
	2.	In Entra, open the Snowflake Enterprise Application and verify existing SCIM provisioning configuration.
	3.	Assign the SNOWFLAKE_SPROUTSOCIAL_ANALYST group to the Snowflake application under Users and Groups.
	4.	Add the S2SNOWFLAKE_POWERBI service account as part of the same configuration.
	5.	Perform a provisioning cycle sync to ensure the group and users are replicated to Snowflake.
	6.	Validate provisioning success from the Snowflake SCIM integration logs.
	7.	Notify Cloud Services and Data Analytics teams once the integration is confirmed.

Implementation by: Cloud Services team
Communication: Internal technical notification via Microsoft Teams and ServiceNow comments. No user-facing communication required.

🔹 Risk and Impact Analysis

	•	Users/Groups Affected: Limited to members of the SNOWFLAKE_SPROUTSOCIAL_ANALYST group.
	•	Impact if Successful: Users in the group will automatically gain access to the relevant Sprout Social datasets in Snowflake without manual provisioning.
	•	Impact if Unsuccessful: Users may not be able to access Sprout Social data in Snowflake. No other systems will be impacted.
	•	Downtime: None. The change is configuration-based and performed in Entra; provisioning occurs asynchronously.
	•	Workaround: Manual account creation in Snowflake can be performed if automated provisioning fails.

⸻

🔹 Backout Plan

	•	If provisioning fails or causes incorrect user assignments, the group assignment will be removed from the Snowflake Enterprise Application in Entra.
	•	This immediately halts further SCIM sync activity for that group.
	•	Changes can be reverted by removing the group mapping and clearing the provisioning cache in Entra.
	•	Rollback time: Approximately 10–15 minutes.
	•	No downstream impact expected beyond Snowflake user access.

⸻

🔹 Test Plan

	•	The SCIM integration between Entra and Snowflake is an established, tested configuration.
	•	This specific change will be verified by manually triggering a provisioning cycle and confirming that the SNOWFLAKE_SPROUTSOCIAL_ANALYST group and its members appear in Snowflake under the correct roles.
	•	Validation includes confirming that:
	1.	The group exists in Snowflake post-sync.
	2.	Assigned users have expected access rights.
	3.	No unrelated user objects were affected.
	•	Evidence (screenshots or provisioning logs) will be attached to the change record once validation is complete.
