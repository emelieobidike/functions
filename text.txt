🔐 Protect What Matters: Secrets Management in Azure Key Vault

As part of our ongoing commitment to secure development practices, it’s important we continue to reinforce the correct use of Azure Key Vault — a vital tool in our cloud security posture. Many of us use it daily, but not everyone may be aware of what should go into Key Vault, or why it’s crucial to set expiry dates on stored secrets. Here’s a quick guide to help you use it more effectively.

🧠 What Should Go into Azure Key Vault?

Azure Key Vault is designed to store and manage sensitive application data. Think of it as a digital safe. You should store:
	•	API keys
	•	Database connection strings
	•	Service principals’ credentials
	•	SAS tokens
	•	Certificate private keys
	•	Encryption keys

⚠️ Connection strings absolutely qualify — especially if they contain usernames, passwords, or access tokens.

What shouldn’t go in Key Vault?
	•	Plaintext configuration values
	•	Static, non-sensitive metadata
	•	Large files (use Blob Storage instead)

If it can grant access or pose a risk if leaked — it belongs in the Key Vault.

📆 Why Set Expiry Dates on Secrets?

Here’s the thing: secrets don’t stay secret forever. Hardcoding them or keeping them indefinitely in Key Vault without expiration increases risk.

Benefits of Setting Expiry Dates:
	•	✅ Reduces exposure window in case credentials are leaked
	•	✅ Encourages regular rotation, which is a best practice
	•	✅ Helps with compliance requirements (e.g., ISO, CIS benchmarks)
	•	✅ Prevents the use of stale credentials in production

Risks of Not Using Expiry Dates:
	•	❌ Secrets could be used by former employees or expired services
	•	❌ You might not know which credentials are active or still in use
	•	❌ Rotations get delayed or forgotten, weakening your security posture

⸻

✅ What You Can Do Today:
	•	Review your Key Vaults and identify secrets with no expiry
	•	Apply a consistent naming convention and tagging (e.g. Owner, Environment)
	•	Implement Azure Policy to enforce secret expiration
	•	Integrate secret rotation with CI/CD pipelines

🔒 Key Vault is only secure if we use it properly. As custodians of our applications and services, we have a shared responsibility to protect the keys to our kingdom. Let’s stay ahead of threats by treating secrets like the sensitive assets they truly are.
