Got you. Below is brief, clean wording you can paste into each Change Request section for the SAML SSO app (TransPerfect GlobalLink).

Change Title

SAML SSO Implementation – TransPerfect GlobalLink

⸻

Description

Configure Azure AD SAML SSO integration for TransPerfect GlobalLink. Access will be restricted via an AD Security Group.

⸻

Planning Tab

Justification

Implement SAML SSO to enable secure authentication to TransPerfect GlobalLink using Azure AD. This improves security, centralizes access control, and aligns with enterprise authentication standards.

⸻

Implementation Plan
	1.	Create Enterprise Application in Azure AD.
	2.	Configure SAML settings per vendor documentation.
	3.	Exchange metadata with TransPerfect.
	4.	Create AD Security Group for authorized users.
	5.	Assign group to Enterprise Application.
	6.	Perform validation testing with test users.
	7.	Enable SSO for production users.

Implementation performed by IAM/SSO team in coordination with vendor.

User communication will be handled by the LOB owner (Tricia Hansen).

⸻

Risk and Impact Analysis
	•	Impacted Users: GlobalLink users only.
	•	Risk: Low.
	•	No expected downtime.
	•	If unsuccessful, users will continue to authenticate via existing login method.
	•	No impact to other systems.

⸻

Backout Plan

If issues occur:
	1.	Disable SAML SSO configuration in Azure AD.
	2.	Remove group assignment if necessary.
	3.	Revert to vendor-managed authentication.

Rollback time: ~15–30 minutes.

⸻

Test Plan
	•	Validate SAML login with test account.
	•	Confirm correct attribute mapping.
	•	Verify group-based access restriction.
	•	Confirm successful login and logout behavior.
	•	Obtain vendor confirmation of successful assertion.

⸻

If you want, I can also tailor this to match your company’s exact change approval language (e.g., make it sound more CAB-friendly or more technical).
