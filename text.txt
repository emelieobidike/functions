Perfect — this is a standard change template.
Below is clean, CAB-ready wording tailored to AWS configuration only and low-risk.

You can copy/paste and adjust names if needed.

Change Title

Configure AWS S3, SQS, and IAM Role for Netskope Web Transaction Log Streaming to CrowdStrike

⸻

Description

This change implements the AWS configuration required to stream Netskope Web Transaction logs from an existing S3 bucket to CrowdStrike via the CrowdStrike S3 Data Connector.

Scope includes:
	•	Creation of two Amazon SQS queues
	•	Configuration of S3 event notifications
	•	Creation of IAM role for CrowdStrike access
	•	Application of required IAM trust and permission policies

No existing production workloads will be modified or interrupted.

⸻

Justification – Why is the change needed?

This change enables integration between Netskope and CrowdStrike NG-SIEM to ingest Web Transaction logs for centralized monitoring, threat detection, and security analytics.

The AWS configuration is required to:
	•	Deliver S3 object creation events to SQS
	•	Allow CrowdStrike to securely assume an IAM role
	•	Permit controlled read-only access to the S3 log bucket

This supports security visibility, compliance requirements, and enhanced incident detection.

⸻

Implementation Plan

The change will be implemented by the IT Cloud Services team.

Step 1 – Create SQS Queues
	•	Create two standard SQS queues:
	•	Queue 1: Netskope Events & Alerts
	•	Queue 2: Netskope Web Transaction logs
	•	Apply SQS access policy allowing s3.amazonaws.com to send messages.

Step 2 – Configure S3 Event Notifications
	•	Navigate to S3 bucket receiving Netskope logs
	•	Add event notifications:
	•	Event type: All object create events
	•	Prefix: Netskope log folder path
	•	Destination: Corresponding SQS queue
	•	Validate notifications are enabled

Step 3 – Create IAM Role for CrowdStrike
	•	Create IAM role for CrowdStrike S3 Data Connector
	•	Configure Trust Policy:
	•	Principal: CrowdStrike AWS account
	•	Include provided External ID
	•	Allow sts:AssumeRole

Step 4 – Attach IAM Permissions

Attach policy allowing:
	•	s3:GetObject on specified object prefix
	•	s3:ListBucket on S3 bucket

Step 5 – Validation
	•	Confirm S3 events populate SQS
	•	Confirm IAM role can be assumed
	•	Confirm no errors in AWS CloudTrail

No user communication required as this is backend configuration with no end-user impact.

Risk and Impact Analysis

Affected Users

None. No end users or business units will be directly impacted.

Systems Affected
	•	AWS S3 (log bucket only)
	•	AWS SQS (new queues)
	•	AWS IAM (new role)

Risk Level

Low.

This change:
	•	Does not modify existing application logic
	•	Does not alter production traffic flow
	•	Introduces read-only IAM access
	•	Can be reversed without service impact

If Unsuccessful
	•	Logs may not be delivered to CrowdStrike
	•	No business-facing systems will be impacted

No downtime expected.

⸻

Backout Plan

If issues occur:
	1.	Remove S3 event notifications.
	2.	Delete SQS queues.
	3.	Delete IAM role created for CrowdStrike.
	4.	Remove associated IAM policies.

Rollback time: ~15–30 minutes
No downstream impact expected after rollback.

⸻

Test Plan

Testing will include:
	•	Upload test object into S3 log prefix
	•	Confirm S3 event triggers SQS message
	•	Validate CrowdStrike can assume IAM role
	•	Confirm no permission errors in CloudTrail

Testing is configuration validation only (no production traffic impact).

Evidence (screenshots/log validation) will be attached to the change record.

If you’d like, I can also:
	•	Reword this for a Standard Change classification
	•	Help you classify it (Normal vs Standard vs Emergency)
	•	Make it shorter if your CAB prefers concise entries
