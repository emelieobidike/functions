Yep — this is a pretty standard low-risk firewall change, so we can fill this cleanly and in “change-board-friendly” language. You can copy/paste the sections below directly into the Change Request.

Change Title

Open TCP Ports 3740 and 3741 for Stealth Agent Communication

⸻

Description

This change will open TCP ports 3740 and 3741 on servers STG\SAZE-SSB-DC01 and STG\SAZC-SSB-DC01 to allow communication from FNC\S1STEALTHINT01. This connectivity is required to support administration and upgrade of Stealth intercept agents.

Planning Tab

Justification

This change is required to allow the Stealth administration console hosted on FNC\S1STEALTHINT01 to communicate with Stealth intercept agents installed on STG\SAZE-SSB-DC01 and STG\SAZC-SSB-DC01. Opening TCP ports 3740 and 3741 enables required management and upgrade functions for the agents. Without this change, agent upgrades and ongoing administration cannot be performed.

⸻

Implementation Plan
	1.	Network/Firewall team will review the request and confirm source and destination servers.
	2.	Create firewall rules to allow inbound TCP traffic on ports 3740 and 3741 from FNC\S1STEALTHINT01 to:
	•	STG\SAZE-SSB-DC01
	•	STG\SAZC-SSB-DC01
	3.	Apply the firewall rules during the approved change window.
	4.	Validate connectivity from FNC\S1STEALTHINT01 to both target servers.
	5.	Confirm Stealth intercept agent communication and perform upgrade validation if required.

Implementation Owner: SSB (Network/Infrastructure team)
User Communication: No end-user communication required as this is an internal infrastructure change with no user-facing impact.

Risk and Impact Analysis
	•	Users affected: None directly.
	•	Systems affected: Stealth intercept agents on STG\SAZE-SSB-DC01 and STG\SAZC-SSB-DC01.
	•	Risk: Low.
	•	Impact if unsuccessful: Stealth agents may be unable to communicate with the administration console, preventing upgrades and management.
	•	User downtime: None expected.

⸻

Backout Plan

If issues are encountered, the firewall rules allowing TCP ports 3740 and 3741 will be removed. Reverting the change will restore the environment to its prior state. No downstream systems are expected to be impacted. Rollback can be completed within minutes.

⸻

Test Plan
	•	Validate TCP connectivity from FNC\S1STEALTHINT01 to ports 3740 and 3741 on both target servers.
	•	Confirm Stealth administration console can successfully communicate with intercept agents.
	•	Verify no unexpected network or system behavior is observed post-change.

If you want, I can also:
	•	Adjust wording to match Normal vs Standard change
	•	Make it more security-focused (for InfoSec reviewers)
	•	Shorten it if your org prefers very tight change requests
