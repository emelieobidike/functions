"Certainly! Here's a C# code snippet using Azure.Data.Tables that loops through a list of 6 Azure Storage accounts and removes table rows older than 365 days:

using Azure;
using Azure.Data.Tables;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
// List of connection strings for the 6 Azure Storage accounts
var connectionStrings = new List<string>
{
"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=account1;AccountKey=key1;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",
// ... Add the other 5 connection strings here
};

// Loop through each connection string
foreach (var connectionString in connectionStrings)
{
// Create a service client
var serviceClient = new TableServiceClient(connectionString);

// Assume you have a single table named "MyTable"
var tableClient = serviceClient.GetTableClient("MyTable");

// Define a filter for rows older than 365 days
string filter = TableClient.CreateQueryFilter($"Timestamp lt {DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddDays(-365):O}");

// Query the table
AsyncPageable<TableEntity> queryResults = tableClient.QueryAsync<TableEntity>(filter);

// Loop through the results and delete each entity
await foreach (var entity in queryResults)
{
await tableClient.DeleteEntityAsync(entity.PartitionKey, entity.RowKey);
}
}
}
}

Make sure to replace the placeholder connection strings with the actual ones for your Azure Storage accounts. This code assumes that all accounts have a table named "MyTable" and that you want to remove rows from this table. Adjust the table name as necessary for your use case.

Please note that this code does not include error handling and logging, which are important for production use. Also, consider implementing batch deletion for better performance when dealing with a large number of entities."
