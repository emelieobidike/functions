Implemented Azure Policies for Key Vault Soft Delete and Purge Protection

Designed and applied Azure Policies to enforce the use of soft delete and purge protection on newly created Azure Key Vaults. As part of this effort, remediated existing Key Vaults by enabling both controls to ensure alignment with security best practices. Communicated policy changes to stakeholders prior to enforcement and implemented deny policies to prevent the creation of non-compliant Key Vaults, strengthening data protection and governance across the environment.
