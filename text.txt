Good afternoon Dallas,

Yes, that aligns well with my understanding.

Based on Trey’s recommendation, the key input we need from Sandy and Tracy is how their team currently manages access and roles within AIO. That will determine whether Azure (Entra ID) should be used strictly for authentication or if there’s value in passing role information as part of SSO.

At a high level, the two options are:

Option 1: Azure used for authentication only (most common / simplest)
- Azure authenticates users via OpenID Connect and sends standard identity claims (UPN/email, name, object ID).
- Sandy and Tracy’s team manages user access and roles directly within AIO.
- Pros: Simpler implementation, fewer dependencies, and aligns with our typical SSO pattern when the business team manages application access.
- Cons: Roles are not centrally managed in Entra ID.

Option 2: Roles or groups passed from Entra ID
- Roles or groups are managed in Entra ID and included in the SSO token.
- AIO consumes those claims to determine user authorization.
- Pros: Centralized role management and potentially more consistency across applications.
- Cons: Added complexity and only beneficial if the application and business process support externalized RBAC.

From a bank standards perspective, we generally default to Azure being auth-only unless there is a clear business or operational need to centralize role management.

Once Sandy and Tracy can confirm how access and roles are handled for their team today, I can finalize the SSO configuration and respond back to AIO.

Thanks,  
Anthony
