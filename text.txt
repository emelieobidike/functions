Good afternoon Dallas,

Thank you — that makes sense, and I agree we should align with existing standards and how the business team operates today.

Based on Trey’s recommendation, the next step would be to understand how Sandy and Tracy’s team currently handles access and roles within AIO. That will help determine whether Azure (Entra ID) should remain authentication-only or whether there’s a real need to pass role information during SSO.

At a high level, the two options are:
	•	Azure auth-only: Azure is used strictly for sign-in, and Sandy/Tracy’s team manages user access and roles directly within AIO (simpler and most common).
	•	Azure roles/groups: Roles or groups are managed centrally in Entra ID and passed to AIO during login (more complex, but useful if centralized RBAC is desired).

To help guide the decision, it would be helpful to confirm with Sandy and Tracy:
	•	Are there different user roles in AIO today?
	•	How is access granted or changed for their team?
	•	Is access management something they prefer to own within AIO, or would they want it centralized via Azure?

Once that’s clarified, I can finalize the SSO configuration and respond back to AIO accordingly.
