**Subject: Upcoming Change: Mandatory HTTPS for App Service Apps**

Dear [App Owner's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

We are writing to inform you about an important policy update regarding the security of our App Service applications. As part of our ongoing commitment to enhance the security and integrity of our applications, we have assigned the Azure policy **“App Service apps should only be accessible over HTTPS”**.

### Current Non-Compliance
It has come to our attention that the following web apps under your management are currently non-compliant with this policy:

1. [Web App 1 Name]
2. [Web App 2 Name]

### Upcoming Changes
To comply with this policy, all App Service apps must be configured to only accept HTTPS traffic. HTTP traffic will be automatically redirected to HTTPS. This change is crucial for ensuring that all data transmitted between the server and clients is encrypted and secure.

### Action Required
Please take the necessary steps to update your web apps to support HTTPS. You can follow these steps to enforce HTTPS:

1. **Navigate to the Azure Portal.**
2. **Select your App Service app.**
3. **Under the 'Settings' section, select 'TLS/SSL settings'.**
4. **Set the 'HTTPS Only' option to 'On'.**

You can find more detailed instructions in the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-bindings#enforce-https).

### Consequences of Non-Compliance
Failing to comply with this policy by [Compliance Deadline Date] will result in:

- Automatic redirection of HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- Potential disruption of service if the HTTPS configuration is not properly set up.
- Increased security risks due to unencrypted data transmission.

### Support
If you require any assistance in making these changes or have any questions regarding this policy, please do not hesitate to contact the IT support team at [Support Email] or refer to the [Azure Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/support/) resources.

We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter to ensure the security and compliance of our applications.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
[Your Position]  
[Your Contact Information]
