Change Title

Implement OIDC SSO for Certificate Manager – SaaS

⸻

Justification

Enable OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (OIDC) SSO integration between Enterprise IdP and Certificate Manager – SaaS to improve authentication security, centralize access control, and align with corporate SSO standards.

⸻

Implementation Plan
	1.	Register new OIDC application in Enterprise IdP.
	2.	Configure redirect URI and required claims per vendor documentation.
	3.	Exchange client ID/secret securely with vendor.
	4.	Configure OIDC settings in Certificate Manager – SaaS.
	5.	Test authentication with pilot user group.
	6.	Validate role/claim mapping.
	7.	Enable SSO in production.
	8.	Monitor authentication logs post-change.

Communication:
	•	Notify impacted users of SSO enablement and login method change.
	•	Communication to be sent by IT.

⸻

Risk and Impact Analysis
	•	Impacted users: All Certificate Manager – SaaS users.
	•	Risk: Authentication failure if configuration is incorrect.
	•	User impact: Potential login issues during cutover.
	•	Downtime: None expected; login method transition only.
	•	Workaround: Local account login (if retained) or rollback to previous authentication method.

⸻

Backout Plan
	1.	Disable OIDC configuration in Certificate Manager – SaaS.
	2.	Revert IdP application configuration.
	3.	Restore previous authentication method.
Estimated rollback time: 15–30 minutes.

⸻

Test Plan
	•	Validate successful login via OIDC.
	•	Validate failed login for unauthorized users.
	•	Confirm correct role/claim mapping.
	•	Test logout and token expiration.
	•	Testing performed in non-production prior to implementation.

⸻

If you’d like, I can tailor it further depending on:
	•	Whether you’re using Azure Entra ID specifically
	•	Whether local accounts will be fully disabled
	•	Whether this is production-only or phased rollout
