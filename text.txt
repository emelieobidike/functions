Subject: Important Update: Enforcing HTTPS for Your Web App

Dear [Client's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

We are reaching out to inform you of an important upcoming change that will affect your web application hosted on our platform. To enhance the security of our services and protect your data, we are updating our policy regarding HTTPS access.

### Upcoming Policy Change:
Effective [Effective Date], we will be implementing a new policy titled “App Service apps should only be accessible over HTTPS” with an enforcement effect of "deny". This means that any App Service applications that are not configured to use HTTPS will face operational restrictions.

### How This Affects Your Web App:
Our recent audit indicates that your web application, [Web App Name], is currently non-compliant with this policy. Here are the key implications for your web app:
- **Creation and Update Restrictions**: Any attempts to create or update non-compliant web apps will be denied until they are configured to enforce HTTPS.
- **Compliance Requirement**: To avoid service disruptions, it is imperative that your web app be updated to comply with the HTTPS requirement before the enforcement date.

### Actions Required:
To ensure continuous operation of your web application, please follow these steps to enable HTTPS:
1. **Enable HTTPS in App Service**:
   - Navigate to your App Service in the Azure Portal.
   - Go to the "TLS/SSL settings" blade.
   - Set "HTTPS Only" to "On".

2. **Verify Compliance**:
   - Ensure that all web traffic is redirected to HTTPS.
   - Test your web application to confirm it is accessible over HTTPS.
