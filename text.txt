Title

Decommission and Delete Unused Linux Server and Associated Azure Resources

⸻

Description

This change involves permanently decommissioning a Linux virtual machine and its associated Azure resources. The server is no longer required for business operations, is not joined to Active Directory, and has no current application dependencies. The VM is currently included in Cohesity backups. The change will remove the server, its disks, NICs, public/private IPs (if any), and backup entries from the portal to reduce unnecessary cloud spend and improve environment hygiene.

📌 Change Form Fields

Justification

The Linux server is no longer required for any business, operational, or application function. It is consuming Azure compute, storage, and backup capacity, resulting in unnecessary cost. Decommissioning the server will remove unused infrastructure, ensure an accurate inventory of active systems, and improve overall environment management.
There are no dependencies tied to this VM, and it is not joined to Active Directory. The responsible team has confirmed that all data or configurations on the server are no longer needed.

Implementation Plan
	1.	Notify stakeholders and confirm downtime window, even though the server is not in use.
	2.	Verify there are no active workloads, services, or processes running on the server.
	3.	Disable Cohesity backup job for the VM and mark the backup object for removal per backup retention policy.
	4.	Gracefully shut down the Linux VM from the Azure portal.
	5.	Delete the VM from the Azure subscription.
	6.	Delete associated resources, including:
	•	OS Disk
	•	Data disks (if any)
	•	Network Interface Card
	•	Public IP / Private IP (if assigned)
	•	Network Security Group (if dedicated)
	7.	Validate that no orphaned resources remain in the Resource Group.
	8.	Update CMDB/asset records to reflect decommissioned status.
	9.	Communicate completion to stakeholders.

Risk and Impact Analysis
	•	People affected: None. No users, groups, or business units rely on this server.
	•	Systems affected: Only the targeted Linux VM and its associated infrastructure.
	•	User impact: None. No applications, workflows, or integrations depend on this server.
	•	Downtime: No downtime impact, as the server is unused.
	•	Risk of unsuccessful change:
	•	Minimal. If the server were deleted in error, recovery would depend on Cohesity backups.
	•	Residual risks:
	•	Once deleted, the VM cannot be recovered outside available backup retention.

Overall risk level: Low

Backout Plan

If the change is unsuccessful or the deletion was performed prematurely:
	1.	Restore the VM from Cohesity backup (full VM restore).
	2.	Recreate the server with prior configuration settings.
	3.	Reattach disks and network components as needed.
	4.	Validate server access and function.

Estimated rollback time: 1–2 hours, depending on backup restore speed.

⸻

Test Plan
	•	Confirm that the server has no active dependencies prior to deletion.
	•	Confirm that Cohesity backup history is available for potential rollback.
	•	After deletion, validate:
	•	The VM no longer appears in Azure portal
	•	Associated disks, NICs, and IPs are removed
	•	Backup job is disabled
	•	No orphaned resources remain
	•	Update CMDB/asset management records.

Testing is complete and comparable to production, as verification is performed directly in the live Azure environment.
