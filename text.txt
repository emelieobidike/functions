Change Title

Run Microsoft Zero Trust Assessment on Azure / Microsoft 365 Tenant

⸻

Description

Execute the Microsoft Zero Trust Assessment tool to perform a comprehensive, read-only evaluation of our Azure / Microsoft 365 tenant. The assessment uses Microsoft’s official module to analyze identity, device, and foundational security configurations against Zero Trust best practices. No changes will be made to production resources. The output will be a detailed posture report highlighting gaps, risks, and recommended remediation steps.

Justification — Why is the change needed? Explain in detail.

This change is required to assess the organization’s current cloud security posture using Microsoft’s official Zero Trust Assessment tool. The assessment aligns our environment with Zero Trust principles and Microsoft Secure Future Initiative guidance. It performs an automated review of identity protection, device compliance, authentication posture, privileged access, conditional access, and logging configurations.

The assessment identifies misconfigurations, security gaps, and improvement opportunities that cannot be easily detected manually. As cyber threats increasingly target cloud identity systems, performing this assessment is essential to ensure the environment is resilient, compliant, and aligned with best practices. The resulting report will provide actionable recommendations for strengthening tenant security.

Implementation Plan — What are the steps needed for the change to be completed?
	1.	Prepare Environment
	•	Confirm access to a workstation with PowerShell 7+.
	•	Validate that the operator has the required Azure AD permissions (initial run requires Global Admin consent; subsequent runs may use Global Reader).
	2.	Install Assessment Module
	•	Run: Install-Module ZeroTrustAssessment -Scope CurrentUser
	3.	Authenticate to Azure AD / Microsoft Graph
	•	Execute: Connect-ZtAssessment
	•	Approve required Graph permissions.
	4.	Run the Microsoft Zero Trust Assessment
	•	Execute: Invoke-ZtAssessment -Path <designated output folder>
	•	Allow the tool to complete processing (may take several hours depending on tenant size).
	5.	Collect and Review the Report
	•	Retrieve the generated HTML report.
	•	Store the report securely due to sensitive content.
	•	Review findings with Cloud Security, IAM, and Governance teams.
	6.	Close Out Activity
	•	Delete local export folder after secure storage.
	•	Plan follow-up remediation CRs as needed.

No production configuration changes will be made during any step.

Risk and Impact Analysis — How many people are affected? What groups? What is the impact?

Impact: None — this is a strictly read-only assessment.
Affected Users: No end users impacted; only Cloud Security / IAM / Azure Administrators will be involved.
Business/System Impact:
	•	No downtime or service interruption expected.
	•	No configuration changes occur.
	•	Minimal operational risk; the assessment only queries data.

Risks:
	•	Assessment report contains sensitive tenant information and must be stored securely.
	•	Discovery of critical gaps may lead to future remediation work.

Mitigation:
	•	Use least-privilege account where possible.
	•	Securely store and limit access to the report.
	•	Close monitoring during assessment execution.

⸻

Backout Plan — If the change is not successful, what is the backup plan?

No backout plan is required because the activity is fully read-only.
If issues arise:
	•	Stop the script or close the session.
	•	No changes are applied to the tenant, so no rollback is needed.
	•	Delete any locally exported sensitive files if the process is halted.

⸻

Test Plan — How has this been tested and validated?

Since this is a read-only assessment, functional testing consists of:
	•	Verifying successful installation of the module.
	•	Confirming that authentication to the tenant works with appropriate permissions.
	•	Ensuring the assessment command (Invoke-ZtAssessment) completes successfully.
	•	Validating that the HTML report is generated, readable, and includes:
	•	Identity posture
	•	Device compliance posture
	•	Risk levels
	•	Pass/Fail test results
	•	Remediation recommendations

Success criteria:
	•	Assessment completes without errors.
	•	Full report is generated and stored securely.
	•	Findings are reviewed by the Security team.
