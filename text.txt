Okay, I can try to write a powershell script to delete rows from an Azure storage table that are older than 365 days while showing percentage completion for you.

Please wait a moment while I create it.

Here is the script that I generated. I hope you find it useful. blush

# Parameters
$StorageAccountName = "YourStorageAccountName"
$StorageAccountKey = "YourStorageAccountKey"
$TableName = "YourTableName"
$Days = 365 # Change this to your desired number of days

# Create storage context
$ctx = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $StorageAccountKey

# Get storage table
$storageTable = Get-AzStorageTable –Name $TableName –Context $ctx

# Get current date minus the number of days
$Date = (Get-Date).AddDays(-$Days)

# Generate filter condition based on Timestamp property
$Filter = [Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Table.TableQuery]::GenerateFilterConditionForDate("Timestamp", "lt", $Date)

# Query the table for entities older than the specified number of days
$Entities = Get-AzTableRow -table $storageTable.CloudTable -customFilter $Filter

# Get the total number of entities to delete
$Total = $Entities.Count

# Initialize a counter for deleted entities
$Deleted = 0

# Loop through the entities and delete them one by one
foreach ($Entity in $Entities) {

# Delete the entity from the table
Remove-AzTableRow -table $storageTable.CloudTable -entity $Entity

# Increment the counter
$Deleted++

# Calculate the percentage of completion
$Percent = ($Deleted / $Total) * 100

# Write the progress to the console
Write-Progress -Activity "Deleting entities from $TableName" -Status "$Deleted of $Total entities deleted ($Percent %)" -PercentComplete $Percent
}

# Write the final result to the console
Write-Host "All $Total entities older than $Days days have been deleted from $TableName"
