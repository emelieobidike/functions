Subject: Enhancing Security for Your Azure VMs with Server-Side Encryption
Dear Valued Client,
As part of our commitment to your security and adherence to best practices, we'll be enabling server-side encryption (SSE) on your Azure virtual machines (VMs). This transparent encryption adds an extra layer of protection for your data at rest.
To implement SSE, a brief VM outage of 10-15 minutes will be necessary. To minimize disruption, we recommend scheduling this activity during our standard Thursday maintenance window.
If this timeframe doesn't suit your needs, please reply to this email with your preferred time for the outage. We'll do our best to accommodate your request.
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. We appreciate your business.
Sincerely,
The [Your Company Name] Team
