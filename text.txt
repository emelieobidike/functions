Anthony, this is a very strong dataset for a leadership-level conversation. I’ll give you exact speaker notes you can use verbatim while you walk them through the dashboard, plus answers to the tough questions they will ask.

⸻

1. Opening – Set the context

“This Zero Trust Assessment is Microsoft’s automated evaluation of how closely our tenant aligns with Zero Trust principles — verify explicitly, use least privilege, and assume breach.
It analyses identity, authentication strength, device compliance and conditional access coverage.”

“The goal isn’t perfection today — it’s to clearly see where our biggest exposure is and what actions will most reduce risk.”

⸻

2. Tenant overview – scale & risk surface

Point to the first dashboard.

Speaker notes:

“We currently have over 9,100 users, 17,400 devices, and 348 enterprise apps integrated into Entra ID.”
“Only about 3,700 devices are managed, meaning the majority of sign-ins are coming from devices we don’t fully control.”

“On the Zero Trust test coverage, we’ve passed 34 out of 97 Identity checks and 9 out of 36 Device checks.
That tells us clearly: we are still early in our Zero Trust maturity.”

⸻

3. Authentication & Conditional Access gap

Point to User authentication / Device sign-ins Sankey diagram.

Speaker notes:

“This is the most critical finding.
Over the last 5 hours, only 68% of sign-ins were protected by Conditional Access with MFA.”

“Even more concerning: only 4.7% of sign-ins came from compliant devices.”

“That means today, most users can successfully authenticate from unmanaged or non-compliant devices with minimal enforcement.”

⸻

4. Privileged users – elevated blast radius

Point to Privileged users auth methods.

Speaker notes:

“This shows the strongest authentication methods used by privileged accounts.
We still see reliance on phishable methods like password and basic phone factors.”

“This is extremely high risk — if one admin credential is phished, the attacker effectively owns the tenant.”

⸻

5. Device compliance & ownership

Point to Device compliance / ownership pie charts.

Speaker notes:

“On paper, device compliance looks decent — 93% compliant — but context matters.”
“Only 15% of devices are corporate-owned.
So compliance is largely coming from personal devices with lighter controls.”

“Zero Trust expects that sensitive access should come from managed, corporate-owned devices wherever possible.”

⸻

6. Desktop posture – hybrid technical debt

Point to Desktop devices view.

Speaker notes:

“97% of our desktops are Entra Hybrid Joined — meaning they’re still heavily dependent on legacy on-prem AD.”
“0% are Entra-native joined.”

“This makes it harder to enforce modern controls like conditional access, device health attestation, and seamless passwordless authentication.”

⸻

7. Mobile risk

Point to Mobile devices view.

Speaker notes:

“We have almost 5,000 mobile devices.
Only 55% of Android and 68% of iOS devices are compliant.”

“This is one of our biggest real-world exposure points — mobile devices are used everywhere and are the hardest to secure after laptops.”

⸻

8. Executive Summary – plain English

“In simple terms:
We’ve built a modern identity platform, but we’re still trusting users far too easily.”

“Most access today does not require strong authentication from secure, managed devices — and that’s exactly how ransomware and identity-based breaches start.”

⸻

9. What this means for the business

“Our current posture significantly increases the risk of:

	•	Account takeover
	•	Privilege escalation
	•	Data exfiltration
	•	Regulatory and audit findings”

⸻

10. The roadmap – what we fix first

Phase 1 – Immediate (30–60 days)

Enforce MFA for all users without exception.
Block legacy authentication protocols.
Require phishing-resistant MFA for privileged accounts.

Phase 2 – 90 days

Conditional Access: only allow access to sensitive apps from compliant devices.
Begin migrating desktops to Entra-native join.

Phase 3 – 6 months

Passwordless strategy — FIDO2 / Windows Hello for Business.
Corporate ownership program for mobile devices.

⸻

Questions leadership WILL ask — and your answers

❓ Are we exposed right now?

Yes — identity is our largest attack surface today. A single compromised user or admin account could lead to a full tenant breach.

⸻

❓ Why is only 4.7% of sign-ins compliant?

Because we currently allow access from unmanaged and personal devices with little enforcement. Compliance is not yet a gate — it’s only being monitored.

⸻

❓ What’s the cost to fix this?

Mostly licensing we already own — the bigger investment is operational change and communication, not new spend.

⸻

❓ What’s the risk if we delay?

Identity-based attacks are now the #1 entry point for breaches globally. The longer we stay here, the higher the likelihood of a serious incident.

⸻

❓ What does success look like in 6 months?

95%+ of sign-ins protected by Conditional Access and MFA.
Admins fully passwordless.
Sensitive apps accessible only from managed, compliant devices.

⸻

If you follow these notes, you will sound measured, confident, and strategic — not alarmist, but clearly in control.
