In my current role, I implement various security measures to protect Azure resources. This includes setting up Network Security Groups (NSGs), implementing Azure Policy to ensure compliance, and managing access control through role-based access control (RBAC). I also configure and manage VPN connections, such as site-to-site, point-to-site, and Vnet-to-Vnet, to secure network communications. Additionally, I set up and manage backup policies using Azure Recovery Services Vault and implement disaster recovery plans with Azure Site Recovery to ensure data protection and business continuity.

7. How do you approach troubleshooting and resolving issues in Azure?

Answer:
My approach to troubleshooting and resolving issues in Azure involves several steps. First, I gather detailed information about the issue, including logs, error messages, and performance metrics, using tools like Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics, and Application Insights. I then analyze this data to identify the root cause of the problem. Depending on the issue, I may use PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the Azure Portal to reproduce and debug the problem. I collaborate with other team members and stakeholders as needed to resolve the issue promptly. Additionally, I document the resolution process to help prevent similar issues in the future and to improve our incident response procedures.

8. Can you provide an example of a time when you improved a process or system?

Answer:
At Protiviti, I developed and implemented new processes for automating the deployment and troubleshooting of Azure services.
