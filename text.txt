Led Azure Key Vault Secret Lifecycle Management Initiative

Led a cross-functional effort to improve Azure Key Vault security posture by reviewing existing Key Vaults with application teams to identify secrets without expiration dates. Coordinated working sessions with stakeholders to understand application dependencies, validate active versus unused secrets, and apply appropriate expiration policies without disrupting production workloads.

As part of this initiative, identified unused or minimally utilized Key Vaults during the review process, confirmed decommissioning eligibility with application owners, and safely removed these resources—reducing security risk and preventing unnecessary cloud costs. This effort required ongoing stakeholder engagement, careful change coordination, and continues into the next year as part of a broader governance and security improvement program.
