Here’s how you can frame your accomplishments in your PMP, categorized by the given sections and written to demonstrate confidence and authority:

1. Drive Shareholder Value & Operational Excellence
	•	Implemented a Storage Pruner for Cost Optimization
Designed and deployed a robust storage pruning system using PowerShell and Azure Automation Accounts. This solution efficiently removed outdated data from target storage accounts, resulting in reduced storage costs and improved resource management.
	•	Streamlined Pipeline Transition for Cloud Products
Successfully migrated the ETS DocFX pipeline from the legacy Weyerhaeuser project to the new Cloud Platform Products project. This transition streamlined operations, enhanced pipeline reliability, and aligned processes with organizational standards.
	•	Enhanced Development Operations Through RBAC Pipeline Migration
Relocated the RBAC repository and pipelines from the Weyerhaeuser project to the Cloud Platform Products project. Introduced advanced error-checking mechanisms in the pipeline to detect and flag invalid JSON files, reducing deployment errors and increasing operational efficiency.
	•	Optimized ADO Custom Task Across Platforms
Rebuilt the Azure DevOps custom task to support both Linux agents using Node.js and Windows agents using PowerShell. This modernization effort enhanced compatibility, improved task reliability, and aligned the tool with cross-platform requirements.
	•	Integrated Encryption at Host in Stargate Server Builds
Successfully implemented encryption at host as a standard part of the Stargate server build process, ensuring consistency, enhancing security, and aligning with best practices.
	•	Handled AWS Server Builds for Clients
Delivered end-to-end server build solutions on AWS for clients, adhering to best practices and delivering projects on time while maintaining high standards of service delivery.

2. Cybersecurity
	•	Strengthened Azure Policies for Security Posture
Enforced comprehensive Azure policies to fortify the organization’s security posture. These policies mitigated risks, enforced compliance, and ensured alignment with the latest security standards.
	•	Implemented Access Removal for Disabled Accounts
Leveraging Splunk, developed and implemented a system to automatically identify and remove access for disabled user accounts of former employees. This proactive measure safeguarded the organization from potential account exploits and insider threats.
	•	Recommended Encryption at Host Over Azure Disk Encryption
Conducted in-depth research and presented encryption at host as a superior alternative to Azure Disk Encryption. My recommendations were accepted, leading to the adoption of this approach, which offered better performance, ease of implementation, and enhanced security features.

3. Governance, Risk & Compliance
	•	Led Boomi DR Tests with NSG Updates
Played an integral role in the Boomi disaster recovery (DR) tests by ensuring that necessary network security group (NSG) rules were updated in real time to facilitate successful testing. These efforts ensured the organization’s readiness for disaster scenarios while maintaining compliance standards.
	•	Completed Comprehensive Safety Training
Fulfilled all mandatory safety training requirements, demonstrating a commitment to compliance, risk awareness, and maintaining a safe working environment.
