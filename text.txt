Perfect — thanks, that’s exactly what I needed.
Based on what you shared, here’s a ready-to-use PowerPoint structure with exact slide content + speaker notes, tuned for a technical audience (manager + IT) and your very low-risk tenant.

You can copy-paste this straight into PowerPoint.

⸻

Slide 1 — Title

Title:
GCP Tenant – Current Security & Hardening Status

Subtitle:
Initial technical assessment – current state & next steps

Footer (optional):
Date • Your name • IT Cloud Services

Speaker note:
“This is a technical status update on our current GCP tenant posture following an initial hardening review.”

⸻

Slide 2 — Scope & Objective

Objective
	•	Review current GCP tenant security posture
	•	Assess readiness against CIS-style hardening expectations
	•	Identify gaps and prerequisites for future workloads

Scope
	•	1 GCP project: Marketing
	•	IAM, logging, security tooling
	•	No production workloads deployed

Speaker note:
“This is not a compliance audit — it’s a technical readiness and posture assessment.”

⸻

Slide 3 — Current GCP Structure

Current Structure
	•	Single standalone GCP project
	•	No GCP Organization
	•	No folder hierarchy
	•	Managed by IT Cloud Services

Implication
	•	All controls are applied at project level only

Speaker note:
“This structure is functional for early or empty tenants, but it limits centralized governance.”

⸻

Slide 4 — Workload & Risk Context

Current Tenant Usage
	•	No compute workloads
	•	No VPCs or firewall rules
	•	No BigQuery datasets
	•	No public endpoints

Risk Context
	•	Tenant is effectively infrastructure-only
	•	Overall security risk is currently low

Speaker note:
“This context is important — our findings should be interpreted with this low usage in mind.”

⸻

Slide 5 — IAM Posture

IAM Overview
	•	4 human users with Owner role
	•	5 users with Editor role
	•	No external users
	•	1 service account key (CrowdStrike integration)

Observations
	•	IAM is permissive but low-risk given no workloads
	•	Would require tightening before production use

Speaker note:
“This is acceptable today, but would not scale safely once workloads are introduced.”

⸻

Slide 6 — Logging Architecture (Positive Finding)

Logging Configuration
	•	Cloud Audit Logs routed to CrowdStrike via Pub/Sub
	•	Default log bucket retains non-audit logs
	•	Audit logs intentionally excluded from _Default

Assessment
	•	Logging design is deliberate and security-aligned
	•	No obvious logging gaps identified

Speaker note:
“This is a strong foundation and aligns well with CIS logging principles.”

⸻

Slide 7 — Logging Detail & Retention

Audit Coverage
	•	Admin Activity logs: enabled
	•	Data Access logs: not applicable (no datasets / workloads)
	•	System & Policy logs: included

Retention
	•	Default log retention applied

Speaker note:
“With no workloads, current logging is sufficient. Retention may need review once data services are introduced.”

⸻

Slide 8 — Security Tooling Status

Current Tooling
	•	CrowdStrike log ingestion: configured and active
	•	Security Command Center (SCC): not enabled

Gap Identified
	•	No native GCP security posture reporting
	•	No CIS benchmark visibility via GCP tooling

Speaker note:
“This is the main functional gap from a reporting and governance standpoint.”

⸻

Slide 9 — Key Limitation Identified

Primary Limitation
	•	No GCP Organization configured

Impact
	•	Cannot enforce org-level policies
	•	Cannot centrally manage security guardrails
	•	Limits future hardening and scalability

Speaker note:
“This is architectural, not operational — nothing is broken, but we’ve hit the maturity ceiling.”

⸻

Slide 10 — Overall Risk Assessment

Current Risk
	•	Low, due to absence of workloads and data

Future Risk (if unchanged)
	•	Inconsistent security controls
	•	Limited preventive enforcement
	•	Reduced audit readiness

Speaker note:
“This is the right time to address these gaps — before workloads arrive.”

⸻

Slide 11 — Recommended Next Steps

Short-Term (Low Impact)
	•	Enable Security Command Center Premium
	•	Use SCC for CIS-style reporting and visibility
	•	Reduce Owner / Editor roles (planned)

Foundational (Before Production Use)
	•	Create GCP Organization
	•	Attach project to Org
	•	Establish baseline governance

Speaker note:
“These steps unlock meaningful hardening when needed.”

⸻

Slide 12 — Decisions / Discussion Points

Discussion Items
	•	Approval to enable SCC Premium
	•	Ownership of GCP Organization creation
	•	Timeline for future GCP workloads

Closing Statement

“The tenant is currently low-risk, well-logged, and suitable for its current use. To scale securely, we need foundational governance in place.”

⸻

Optional: SCC Premium Talking Point (for Q&A)

If SCC pricing comes up, say:

“SCC Premium pricing is asset-based and varies by enabled services. We’d need to model cost once workloads are defined, but enabling it early gives us posture visibility with minimal current cost due to low asset count.”

⸻

Next step (I recommend this)

If you want, I can:
	•	Convert this into a downloadable PPT file
	•	Add a 1-slide exec summary your manager can forward upward
	•	Prep short answers for likely follow-up questions

Just tell me which one you want next, and good luck tomorrow — you’re walking in very well prepared.
