Change Title

Enforce Purge Protection and Soft Delete on New Azure Key Vaults via Policy

⸻

Description

This change will deploy an Azure Policy that denies the creation of new Key Vault resources unless both soft delete and purge protection are enabled. The policy ensures compliance with organizational data protection and recovery standards by preventing accidental or malicious deletion of critical secrets and keys.

⸻

Risk

Low.
The policy only affects new Key Vault deployments and does not modify existing resources. However, there is a minor risk that deployment pipelines or automation scripts that do not explicitly enable soft delete and purge protection may fail when creating new Key Vaults.

⸻

Why is this change necessary

Enabling purge protection and soft delete is a security and compliance requirement that ensures sensitive data stored in Key Vaults cannot be permanently deleted without retention safeguards. This policy enforces organizational best practices for data recovery, minimizes risk of data loss, and aligns with compliance frameworks that require protection against accidental or malicious deletion.
