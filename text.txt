Good afternoon David,

We’ve confirmed that Azure (Entra ID) will be used strictly for authentication for this integration. No application roles or role-based claims will be passed in the OIDC token.

Azure will provide standard identity claims only (e.g., UPN/email, name, object ID). User roles and authorization will be managed within AIO.

Since roles are handled in AIO, there is no role-to-claim mapping to provide and the “one test user per role” item does not apply. We can provide a standard test user for SSO authentication testing if needed.

Please let us know if anything further is required.

Thank you,  
Anthony
