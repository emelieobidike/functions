Ah — thanks for sticking with it. This isn’t you, and it’s not the wording.
What’s happening is a UI rendering bug with writing blocks: when the block “finalizes,” it collapses spaces in some environments. That’s why it looks fine while typing and then breaks.

Fix: don’t use a writing block here. Below is the same email in plain text, which will preserve spacing correctly when you copy/paste into Outlook, Gmail, or Teams.

Subject: Action required: TLS 1.3 enforcement for App Services (Deadline: 2 April)

Hi Team,

As part of our security hardening work, we are enforcing TLS 1.3 across all Azure Function Apps and Web Apps.

While many apps have already been updated, some are still outstanding. We are setting a hard deadline of 2 April for completion.

What we need from you
	•	Please update the apps you own to TLS 1.3 before 2 April
	•	If no action is taken, we will proceed with the update on your behalf after the deadline

Affected apps

Function Apps

Function App Name	Resource Group	Environment


              |               |            

Web Apps

Web App Name	Resource Group	Environment


         |               |            

How to make the change

Via Azure Portal
	•	App Service → Configuration → General settings
	•	Set Minimum TLS version to 1.3
	•	Save and restart the app

Via code / IaC
	•	Ensure your configuration (ARM, Bicep, Terraform, etc.) explicitly sets minTlsVersion = 1.3
	•	Please also validate that your application code and dependencies support TLS 1.3

If you have concerns or foresee issues meeting the deadline, please let us know as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Anthony

If you want, next I can:
	•	Strip this down even more (ultra-short, exec-friendly)
	•	Make a “final notice” version for closer to the deadline
	•	Reformat the tables for Excel or CSV so you can mail-merge cleanly
